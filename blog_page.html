              same service that it used to provide because it relies on shipping
              companies, and "without their help" the app is not able to work
              the way that customers expect. In time, the Deliveries app will
              likely stop showing direct tracking information in the app for
              additional services. Delivery date, map route, and other details
              will not be available, nor will notifications about status
              changes. To see tracking information, customers will need to use
              the "View Online" button to see tracking information on the
              shipping company's website.<br />

              Following the March 31 release of iOS 15.4.1, Apple has stopped
              signing iOS 15.4, the previously available version of iOS that
              came out earlier in March. As iOS 15.4 is no longer being signed,
              it is not possible to downgrade to that version of iOS once you've
              installed iOS 15.4.1. Apple routinely stops signing older versions
              of software updates after new releases come out in order to
              encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date, so
              it is not unusual that iOS 15.4 is no longer being signed. iOS
              15.4 was a major update featuring support for unlocking an iPhone
              while wearing a mask, new emoji characters, Universal Control on
              the iPad, and tons more.<br />

                >released a new update</a
              >
              for Safari Technology Preview, the experimental browser Apple
              first introduced in March 2016. Apple designed the Safari
              Technology Preview to test features that may be introduced into
              future release versions of Safari. Safari Technology Preview
              release 143 includes bug fixes and performance improvements for
              Web Inspector, CSS Container Queries, CSS Cascade Layers, Subgrid,
              CSS, JavaScript, Rendering, Web Animations, SVG, Scrolling,
              WebAuthn, WebGL, HTML, Web API, Media, Accessibility, File System
              Access, and Web Extensions. The current Safari Technology Preview
              release is built on the Safari 15.4 update and it includes Safari
              15 features introduced in macOS Monterey.<br />
